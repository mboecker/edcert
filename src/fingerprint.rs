//! This module contains the trait `Fingerprint`. It provides a fingerprint() method, which is
//! used in cryptographic context to identify some value. For example, a `Certificate` implements
//! `Fingerprint` and returns its public key on fingerprint(). On the other hand, secure
//! containers (like Letter<T> in edcert-letter) could return a hash of the contained value.

/// The fingerprint method should return a value that is unique to the implementing type.
pub trait Fingerprint {
    /// The fingerprint method should return a value that is unique to the implementing type.
