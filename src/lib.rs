//! This crate is a simple digital signature crate and can be used to verify data integrity by
//! using public-key cryptography. It uses the "super-fast, super-secure" elliptic curve and
//! digital signature algorithm [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) (EdDSA).
//!
//! It provides the struct "Certificate", which holds the public key, metadata and a signature.
//!
//! # The basics
//! A Certificate can be signed by a master key, or another Certificate. The top-most Certificate
//! must be signed with the master key, or it will not be valid. For validation, the master public
//! key will be given. This way, a Certificate can only be valid, if it has been signed with a
//! trust chain, which top-most Certificate has been signed with the right private key.
//!
//! See also [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA).
//!
//! ## Other crates
//!
//! To use the edcert ecosystem, there are a few other crates to make your life simpler:
//!
//! - [edcert-letter](https://crates.io/crates/edcert-letter), which provides a container for
//!    signed data, Letter&lt;T&gt;.
//! - [edcert-restrevoke](https://crates.io/crates/edcert-restrevoke), which provides a REST-based
//!   revokation system.
//! - [edcert-compressor](https://crates.io/crates/edcert-compressor), which provides methods to
//!   (de)compress Certificates using JSON/LZMA and manages loading/saving certificates for you.
//! - [edcert-tools](https://crates.io/crates/edcert-tools), which provides a binary for
//!   generation, signing, validation, etc using edcert (and all of the above).
